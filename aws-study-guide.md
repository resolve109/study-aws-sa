## Auto Scaling and Capacity Management

### Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
- **Scheduled Scaling**:
  - Configure automatic scaling based on predictable load changes 
  - Create scheduled actions to increase or decrease capacity at specific times 
  - Can proactively adjust the number of EC2 instances in anticipation of known load changes 
  - Optimizes costs and performance by ensuring sufficient capacity during peak times 
  - Eliminates lag in scaling up resources, addressing slow application performance issues under sudden load 
  - Modifying an Auto Scaling group to span multiple AZs is crucial for high availability. 
  - For global redundancy, consider distributing instances across Regions (if truly multi-Region).

## Best Practices and Key Concepts

- **Use read replicas** in Aurora (or RDS) to offload read traffic and improve performance for primary databases.  
- **Enable EBS encryption by default** at the EC2 account attribute level to ensure all new volumes are encrypted (enhancing data security).  
- **Use an Auto Scaling group** spanning multiple AZs with an **Application Load Balancer** to improve availability and automatically scale out/in based on demand.  
- **Attach AWS WAF** to the ALB or CloudFront for web application protection against common exploits.  
- **Use S3 Access Points** for granular access to subsets of data in a shared S3 bucket (simplifies managing data access for multiple applications or tenants).  
- **Use S3 Event Notifications** + **Amazon SQS** + **AWS Lambda** to trigger short-lived image processing tasks without needing dedicated EC2 instances (serverless on-demand processing).  
- **Amazon ECS + AWS Fargate** for scheduled container-based workloads (use EventBridge for cron-like scheduling of tasks without managing servers).  
- **AWS Transit Gateway** is recommended for scaling to 100+ VPCs or large multi-account environments (simplifies network management with a hub-and-spoke model).  
- **Kinesis Data Streams + Amazon OpenSearch Service** for near real-time data ingestion, analysis, search, and building dashboards (e.g., with QuickSight) on streaming data.  
- **Use Amazon EventBridge** to capture specific AWS API events and trigger automated actions: Configure an EventBridge rule (fed by CloudTrail events) for critical operations (e.g., an EC2 CreateImage API call) to send an SNS alert or invoke a Lambda. This provides real-time notifications of important activities with minimal operational overhead (no manual log polling).  
- **AWS Config** can monitor resource configurations but does not enforce encryption or block resource creation; it is primarily for auditing and compliance checks.  
- **Use AWS Organizations** and **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** for centralized governance across multiple AWS accounts (apply guardrails and manage account policies from a single place).  
- **Use Amazon EFS** for a shared POSIX-compliant file system across multiple EC2 instances (and across multiple AZs) when applications require common file storage.  
- **For DR scenarios with minimal downtime**: 
  - Pre-provision resources in a secondary region (e.g., have an Auto Scaling group, load balancer, and a global DynamoDB table in the DR region). 
  - Use DNS failover to direct traffic to the DR region's load balancer if the primary region fails.  
- **For S3 multi-region** active-active design with minimal management: 
  - Use **S3 Multi-Region Access Points** with a single global endpoint. 
  - Configure Cross-Region Replication for durability and cross-region failover of data.  
- **Amazon Security Lake** for centralized aggregation of security data across accounts and regions (makes it easier to run analysis or threat detection on combined logs).  
- **Use Amazon Neptune** for applications that need to store and navigate complex relational data (e.g., social graphs or network topologies) in a graph database.  
- **AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys** give you control over key rotation schedules, key usage policies, and full key lifecycle management (use when you need explicit control beyond AWS-managed keys).  
- **For a serverless architecture behind API Gateway**: 
  - Use AWS Lambda for handling unpredictable or spiky request patterns (scales automatically with demand). 
  - Use DynamoDB for a fully managed NoSQL database with auto-scaling throughput. 
  - This combination yields a completely serverless stack that scales with demand and has minimal maintenance.  
- **Hospital Scanning & Document Processing**: 
  - Store scanned documents in Amazon S3. 
  - Use S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function. 
  - Extract text with Amazon Textract or Amazon Rekognition (for images), then use Amazon Comprehend (or Comprehend Medical) for deeper NLP analysis. 
  - Query the results with Amazon Athena for on-demand analytics.  
- **Static + Dynamic Website**: 
  - Host static content in Amazon S3 (for scalability and low cost). 
  - Use Amazon API Gateway + AWS Lambda for dynamic requests (serverless backend). 
  - Store dynamic data in Amazon DynamoDB (on-demand capacity for unpredictable traffic). 
  - Use Amazon CloudFront to deliver the entire website globally with low latency.  
- **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**: 
  - In-memory cache for DynamoDB 
  - Significantly improves read performance (microsecond latency) without major application rework (just use the DAX client) 
  - Ideal for read-intensive workloads that require microsecond response times 
  - This update increases overall system responsiveness in high-traffic scenarios.

## VPC Flow Logs and Monitoring
- **VPC Flow Logs**:
  - Feature to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a VPC 
  - Flow log data can be published to CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose 
  - Helps diagnose overly restrictive security group rules 
  - Monitors traffic reaching instances 
  - Determines the direction of traffic to/from network interfaces 
  - Additional logging details help in proactive network troubleshooting.

## Analysis and ETL Solutions
- **For Clickstream Data in S3**:
  - Use AWS Glue crawler to catalog data and make it queryable 
  - Configure Amazon Athena for SQL-based analysis of the data 
  - Minimal operational overhead as both services are serverless and fully managed 
  - Enables quick analysis for decision-making about further processing 
  - Confirmed as a best practice for real-time web analytics.
- **Document Ingestion and Transformation**:
  - Store large volumes of documents in Amazon S3 
  - Use AWS Lambda triggers on object upload

  - Use Amazon Comprehend (or Comprehend Medical) to extract relevant information 
  - Store extracted data in S3 or a database, queryable via Athena 
  - Validated for transforming scanned documents into searchable data.

## Resource Tagging and Cost Allocation
- **AWS Lambda with EventBridge**:
  - Can be used to automatically tag resources with cost center IDs 
  - EventBridge detects resource creation events via CloudTrail 
  - Lambda function queries databases for appropriate cost center information 
  - Enables automatic tagging based on the user who created the resource 
  - Provides a proactive and dynamic approach to resource tagging 
  - Ensures consistent tagging and cost allocation across resources.

## Big Data Processing
- **Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)**:
  - Industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data 
  - Supports open source tools like Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Flink 
  - Cluster configuration options for cost-optimization:
    - **Transient clusters**: Terminated after completing tasks, most cost-effective for workloads with known duration 
    - **Long-running clusters**: Stay active continuously, less efficient for workloads with specific durations 
    - **Primary node and core nodes on On-Demand Instances**: Ensures reliability for critical parts of the workload 
    - **Task nodes on Spot Instances**: Cost-effective for compute-intensive portions of workload that can tolerate interruptions 
  - EMR configurations are optimized for both transient and long-running workloads.

## High Availability Architectures

- **For MySQL and stateless Python web applications**:
  - Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability 
  - Use an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling groups of EC2 instances across multiple AZs for the web/application tier 
  - RDS Multi-AZ provides automatic failover to a standby instance in a different AZ, improving resiliency 
  - Confirmed as the preferred architecture for high availability.
- **For Global Applications Needing Multi-Region Redundancy**:
  - Deploy workload components in a secondary region (including data stores and compute) 
  - Use RouteÂ 53 or AWS Global Accelerator to route users to the nearest healthy endpoint or fail over if a region goes down 
  - Verified multi-region designs to maintain global availability.
- **For Applications Requiring Zero Downtime and No Data Loss**:
  - Consider active-active multi-region architectures (using global databases like DynamoDB global tables or Aurora Global Database)
