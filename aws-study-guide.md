- **Versioning & MFA Delete**:
  - Enable versioning and MFA delete to add extra protection against accidental/malicious deletions of objects.
  - Validated best practice for critical data.
  - When an object is deleted from a versioned bucket, a delete marker is placed on the current version, while older versions remain, enabling recovery of the prior version.
  - Versioning in S3 keeps multiple variants of an object in the same bucket
  - With versioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored
  - After versioning is enabled, if S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of those objects
  - MFA Delete requires the bucket owner to include two forms of authentication in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state
  - MFA Delete provides additional authentication for: changing the versioning state of your bucket and permanently deleting an object version
  - While bucket policies can restrict access based on conditions, they don't directly protect against accidental deletion like versioning and MFA Delete do
  - Default encryption ensures objects are encrypted at rest but doesn't protect against deletion

  - **Bucket Policy with VPC Endpoint**: Adding a bucket policy that restricts access to only traffic coming from the VPC endpoint ensures data never traverses the public internet
- **S3 Cross-Region Replication**:
  - Automatically and asynchronously copies objects across S3 buckets in different AWS Regions
  - Most operationally efficient way to maintain copies of data in multiple regions
  - Requires versioning to be enabled on both source and destination buckets
  - Only replicates new objects created after replication is configured (existing objects must be copied manually)

  - This approach aligns with security best practices by ensuring users have only the permissions necessary for their job functions
  - More effective for departmental permission management than using SCPs or permissions boundaries
  - IAM roles are intended for delegation scenarios, not for direct attachment to IAM groups
  - For cross-account or service-based permissions, roles are more appropriate than group-based policies
- **Identity-Based Policies**:
  - Can be attached to:
    - IAM roles
    - IAM groups
  - Cannot be directly attached to:
    - AWS Organizations (which use Service Control Policies instead)
    - Amazon ECS resources (which use IAM roles for tasks)
    - Amazon EC2 resources (which use instance profiles/roles)
  - Understanding proper policy attachment points helps ensure effective permission management
  - Following this guidance helps maintain proper security boundaries between service roles
- **Identity-Based Policies**:
  - Can be attached to:

  - More secure than using IAM users with access keys
  - More appropriate than using Secrets Manager or Certificate Manager
  - Follows IAM best practices for cross-account access
- **IP-Based Access Control**:
  - IAM policies can use IP address conditions to restrict access:
    - Use NotIpAddress condition with aws:SourceIp to deny actions from unauthorized IP ranges
  - Will deny actions (like EC2 termination) when requests originate from IP addresses outside specified ranges
  - Particularly useful for administrative actions that should only be performed from secure networks
  - Enforces security at the API action level rather than just network level
- **AWS IAM Password Policies**:
  - Can define password complexity requirements at the account level that apply to all IAM users

## Networking and Content Delivery

### Amazon VPC
- **Internet Gateways**:
  - A single Internet Gateway can route traffic for the entire VPC (across all AZs) 
  - Internet Gateways provide a target in VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic 
  - Do not require redundancy across Availability Zones (they are a managed service) 
- **Managed Prefix Lists**:
  - Sets of one or more CIDR blocks to simplify security group and route table configurations 
  - Customer-managed prefix lists can be shared across AWS accounts via AWS Resource Access Manager 
  - Helps centrally manage allowed IP ranges across an organization 
  - Makes it easier to update and maintain security groups and route tables 
  - Can consolidate multiple security group rules (with different CIDRs but same port/protocol) into a single rule 
- **NAT Gateways**:
  - Managed service provided by AWS allowing instances in private subnets to connect to the internet or other AWS services
  - Do not require patching, are automatically scalable, and provide built-in redundancy for high availability
  - Should be placed in different Availability Zones for fault tolerance
  - Replacing NAT instances with NAT gateways in different AZs ensures high availability and automatic scaling
  - For multi-AZ high availability, create a NAT gateway in each public subnet for each Availability Zone. Then the route tables for private subnets route traffic to their local NAT gateway.
  - Best practice for high availability is to create one NAT gateway in each AZ where you have private subnets
  - This design ensures that if one AZ becomes unavailable, instances in other AZs can still access the internet
  - Using NAT gateways is preferred over NAT instances as they're managed services that automatically scale and are more fault-tolerant
  - NAT instances require more management and manual intervention for high availability and scaling
  - A VPC can only have one internet gateway attached at any time
  - Egress-only internet gateways are specifically designed for outbound-only IPv6 traffic, not for IPv4 traffic
  - For multi-AZ redundancy, it's recommended to create NAT gateways in each public subnet and configure private subnet route tables to forward traffic to the NAT gateway in the same AZ
  - This approach maintains high availability by ensuring if one AZ becomes unavailable, the other AZs can still provide internet access for EC2 instances
- **Security Groups**:
  - For bastion host setups, the security group of the bastion host should only allow inbound access from the external IP range of the company
  - For application instances in private subnets, the security group should allow inbound SSH access only from the private IP address of the bastion host
  - This configuration ensures that only connections from company locations can reach the bastion host, and only the bastion host can access application servers
  - For web tiers in multi-tier architectures, configure the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 (HTTPS from the internet)
  - For database tiers, configure the security group to allow inbound traffic only on the specific database port (e.g., 1433 for SQL Server) from the web tier's security group
  - These configurations follow the principle of least privilege and enhance overall security posture
- **VPC Connectivity Options**:
  - For connecting two VPCs in the same region within the same AWS account, VPC peering is the most cost-effective solution
  - VPC peering provides direct network connectivity that enables inter-VPC communication with minimal operational overhead
  - More cost-effective than Transit Gateway for simpler networking scenarios with moderate data transfer (e.g., 500 GB monthly)
  - Simpler than Site-to-Site VPN which introduces unnecessary complexity and additional costs
  - Not suited for Direct Connect which is designed for connecting on-premises networks to AWS
  - Requires updating route tables in each VPC to use the peering connection for inter-VPC communication
- **Expanding VPC Address Space**:
  - To resolve insufficient IP addresses in a VPC with minimal operational overhead:
    - Add an additional IPv4 CIDR block to the existing VPC
    - Create additional subnets using the new CIDR range
    - Place new resources in the new subnets
  - This approach is more efficient than:
    - Creating a second VPC with peering connection
    - Using Transit Gateway to connect multiple VPCs
    - Setting up VPN connections between VPCs
- **Gateway Endpoints for S3 Cost Reduction**:
  - For EC2 instances in private subnets that access S3 frequently, provisioning a VPC gateway endpoint eliminates data transfer costs
  - Configure route tables for private subnets to use the gateway endpoint for S3 traffic instead of NAT gateways
  - Eliminates data processing and transfer costs associated with routing S3 traffic through NAT gateways
  - More cost-effective than using NAT instances or multiple NAT gateways for S3 access
  - Provides direct, private connectivity to S3 without traversing the public internet or NAT devices
### VPC Security Best Practices
- **Multi-tier Security Group Configuration**:
  - For securing two-tier architectures with web and database layers:
    - Create a security group for web servers allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 on port 443
    - Create a security group for database instances allowing inbound traffic only from the web server security group on the database port
  - References security groups rather than CIDR blocks for finer control of database access
  - More secure than allowing database access from the entire public subnet CIDR
  - Avoids using network ACLs which are stateless and require separate inbound/outbound rules
  - Follows principle of least privilege by limiting database access to only web servers
  - Security groups don't support deny rules; they're stateful and only need allow rules
  - Simplifies security management as new web servers automatically get database acces
### Network Load Balancer
- **TLS for Data in Transit**:
  - For securing data transmission in multi-tier applications:
    - Configure a TLS listener on the Network Load Balancer
    - Deploy the server certificate on the NLB
  - Ensures encryption of data between clients and the load balancer
  - Essential for applications processing sensitive information like sensor data
  - Protects data in transit across all tiers of the application
  - More directly addresses transport security than WAF or Shield (which focus on different security aspects)
### Amazon VPC
- **NAT Gateways for Internet Access from Private Subnets**:
  - For EC2 instances in private subnets that need to communicate with external services (like license servers):
    - Provision a NAT gateway in a public subnet
    - Modify each private subnet's route table with a default route pointing to the NAT gateway
  - This is a managed solution that minimizes operational maintenance compared to NAT instances
  - NAT gateways must be placed in public subnets, not private subnets
  - Creates a scalable, highly available solution that doesn't require patching or maintenance
  - Appropriate for three-tier web applications where application and database tiers need outbound internet access
- **Public Subnet Placement**:
  - NAT gateways must be provisioned in a public subnet to provide internet access for resources in private subnets
  - Placing NAT gateways in a private subnet would prevent them from routing traffic to the internet
  - For three-tier applications, a NAT gateway enables application servers in private subnets to access external services
  - Always configure NAT gateways in public subnets with routing to an Internet Gateway

### AWS PrivateLink

  - Perfect solution for applications that process sensitive information from S3 when compliance requirements prohibit internet transit
  - Eliminate data transfer fees between EC2 instances and S3 within the same region when using gateway endpoints
  - Can be combined with bucket policies to restrict S3 access to only traffic coming from specific VPC endpoints
  - More cost-effective than using NAT gateways or internet gateways for S3 access from private subnets
- **Private Connectivity Between Services**:
  - For ensuring application traffic between EC2 and S3 doesn't traverse the public internet:
    - Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3
  - Enables private connectivity between instances in VPC and S3 without internet exposure
  - No need for internet gateway, NAT device, VPN, or Direct Connect connections
  - More appropriate than AWS KMS which manages encryption keys, not network paths
  - Superior to just using private subnets which still require internet gateway or NAT for S3 access
  - Better solution than virtual private gateways which connect VPCs to on-premises networks

- **Data Transfer Benefits**:
  - Provides a dedicated network connection from on-premises to AWS
  - Offers more reliable and consistent network experience than internet-based connections
  - Reduces bandwidth limitations and improves performance for large data transfers
  - Ideal for transferring time-sensitive data to Amazon S3
  - Separates backup traffic from regular internet usage to minimize impact on users
- **Cost Optimization Options**:
  - For connections with low utilization (e.g., less than 10% usage of a 1 Gbps connection), consider a hosted connection with lower capacity
  - Contact an AWS Direct Connect Partner to order a hosted connection (e.g., 200 Mbps) tailored to actual usage requirements
  - Hosted connections provide the same security benefits as dedicated connections but at lower costs when full capacity isn't needed
  - More cost-effective than maintaining a full 1 Gbps connection when only a fraction of the capacity is utilized
  - Better than connection sharing, which doesn't fundamentally address low utilization issues

### Amazon VPC
- **Internet Gateways**:
  - A single Internet Gateway can route traffic for the entire VPC (across all AZs) 
  - Internet Gateways provide a target in VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic 
  - Do not require redundancy across Availability Zones (they are a managed service) 
- **Managed Prefix Lists**:
  - Sets of one or more CIDR blocks to simplify security group and route table configurations 
  - Customer-managed prefix lists can be shared across AWS accounts via AWS Resource Access Manager 
  - Helps centrally manage allowed IP ranges across an organization 
  - Makes it easier to update and maintain security groups and route tables 
  - Can consolidate multiple security group rules (with different CIDRs but same port/protocol) into a single rule 
- **NAT Gateways**:
  - Managed service provided by AWS allowing instances in private subnets to connect to the internet or other AWS services
  - Do not require patching, are automatically scalable, and provide built-in redundancy for high availability
  - Should be placed in different Availability Zones for fault tolerance
  - Replacing NAT instances with NAT gateways in different AZs ensures high availability and automatic scaling
  - For multi-AZ high availability, create a NAT gateway in each public subnet for each Availability Zone. Then the route tables for private subnets route traffic to their local NAT gateway.
  - Best practice for high availability is to create one NAT gateway in each AZ where you have private subnets
  - This design ensures that if one AZ becomes unavailable, instances in other AZs can still access the internet
  - Using NAT gateways is preferred over NAT instances as they're managed services that automatically scale and are more fault-tolerant
  - NAT instances require more management and manual intervention for high availability and scaling
  - A VPC can only have one internet gateway attached at any time
  - Egress-only internet gateways are specifically designed for outbound-only IPv6 traffic, not for IPv4 traffic
  - For multi-AZ redundancy, it's recommended to create NAT gateways in each public subnet and configure private subnet route tables to forward traffic to the NAT gateway in the same AZ
  - This approach maintains high availability by ensuring if one AZ becomes unavailable, the other AZs can still provide internet access for EC2 instances
- **Security Groups**:
  - For bastion host setups, the security group of the bastion host should only allow inbound access from the external IP range of the company
  - For application instances in private subnets, the security group should allow inbound SSH access only from the private IP address of the bastion host
  - This configuration ensures that only connections from company locations can reach the bastion host, and only the bastion host can access application servers
  - For web tiers in multi-tier architectures, configure the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 (HTTPS from the internet)
  - For database tiers, configure the security group to allow inbound traffic only on the specific database port (e.g., 1433 for SQL Server) from the web tier's security group
  - These configurations follow the principle of least privilege and enhance overall security posture

    - Add a second set of VPNs from a second customer gateway device
    - This provides redundancy for the on-premises connection
  - More effective than adding a second virtual private gateway to the VPC
  - Better than adding redundant VPC peering or VPNs between VPCs
  - Addresses the specific single point of failure in the customer gateway

### Backup Strategy for Stateless Applications
- **Best Practices**:
  - For stateless web applications in Auto Scaling groups:
    - Retain the latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) of the web and application tiers
    - Enable automated backups in RDS and use point-in-time recovery to meet RPO requirements
  - This approach efficiently leverages the stateless nature of the application
  - No need for continuous snapshot backups of EC2 instances' EBS volumes since critical data resides in the database
  - Provides quick and efficient method to restore components if necessary
  - More cost-effective than taking EBS snapshots for stateless applications
  - Avoids unnecessary storage costs and management overhead

### S3 Lifecycle Management
- **IoT Data Management Strategy**:
  - For IoT applications generating trillions of objects annually:
    - Use S3 Standard storage class for data less than 30 days old
    - Create lifecycle policies to transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days
    - Move data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year for archival purposes
  - This approach optimizes storage costs based on access patterns
  - Provides appropriate performance for daily ML model retraining with recent data
  - Supports periodic analysis (e.g., quarterly) with data up to 1 year old
  - Ensures cost-effective long-term retention while maintaining appropriate access times for different use cases

### License-Compatible EC2 Options
- **For Commercial Off-the-Shelf Applications**:
  - When migrating applications with socket/core licensing models:
    - Use Dedicated Reserved Hosts to leverage existing licenses
    - Provides visibility into the physical cores and sockets for license compliance
    - Most cost-effective option for predictable workloads with long-term steady usage
  - More suitable than Dedicated Reserved Instances which don't provide socket-level visibility
  - More cost-effective than On-Demand options for stable, predictable workloads
  - Essential for software with licensing tied to physical hardware characteristics

### Aurora PostgreSQL for Reporting
- **Minimizing Application Impact**:
  - For improving reporting performance with minimal code changes:
    - Set up an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster that includes an Aurora Replica
    - Direct reporting queries to the Aurora Replica instead of the primary instance
  - Provides complete PostgreSQL compatibility, requiring minimal application changes
  - Efficiently offloads read-heavy reporting workloads from the primary database
  - Prevents reporting processes from impacting document modifications or additions
  - Superior to Multi-AZ RDS deployments whose secondary instances aren't accessible for queries
  - More compatible with existing PostgreSQL code than migrating to NoSQL solutions

### EventBridge for Resource Scheduling
- **Start/Stop EC2 and RDS Instances**:
  - Create Lambda functions to start/stop EC2 instances and RDS instances on a schedule
  - Configure EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) to invoke these functions based on cron expressions
  - More cost-effective than running a dedicated EC2 instance to manage the scheduling
  - Easier to maintain than shell scripts and crontab
  - Fully serverless solution with minimal operational overhead
  - Ideal for non-production environments that only need to run during business hours

### S3 Storage Cost Optimization
- **Intelligent-Tiering for Unknown Access Patterns**:
  - Create S3 Lifecycle configuration rules to transition objects to S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  - Perfect for data with unpredictable or changing access patterns
  - Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers
  - Optimizes storage costs without performance impact or operational overhead
  - More cost-effective than manual tier selection when access patterns are unknown

### AWS Snowball Edge for Data Transfer
- **Large Data Migration Use Cases**:
  - Most cost-effective solution for transferring petabytes of data to AWS within tight timeframes
  - Ideal when internet bandwidth constraints would make online transfer take months or years
  - Securely transfers large datasets using physical devices with encryption
  - More practical than Direct Connect or internet-based transfers for one-time large migrations
  - Particularly valuable when transfer must be completed within a specific timeframe (e.g., 2 weeks)
  - Encrypted-by-default for sensitive data protection during transit
- **Cost Optimization for Tight Timeframes**:
  - For transferring massive datasets (e.g., 5 PB) to AWS with bandwidth limitations:
    - AWS Snowball/Snowball Edge devices provide offline data transfer capability
    - Significantly reduces transfer time compared to internet-based transfers
    - Ensures transfer can complete within required business timeframes (e.g., 2 weeks)
    - More efficient than Direct Connect for one-time transfers of multi-petabyte scale
  - Most appropriate option when physical shipping is faster than network transfer
  - Essential when business requirements demand transfer completion by specific dates
  - More reliable than attempting to maximize internet bandwidth for extremely large datasets

### VPC CIDR Selection
- **For VPC Peering Connections**:
  - When creating a new VPC to peer with an existing VPC (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24), select a non-overlapping CIDR block
  - A CIDR block like 10.0.1.0/24 is appropriate as it doesn't overlap with 192.168.0.0/24
  - Avoid using the same CIDR block (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) as the existing VPC
  - Don't use /32 subnet masks (e.g., 10.0.1.0/32 or 192.168.1.0/32) as they represent single IP addresses, not usable ranges
  - Ensure the CIDR block is large enough to support your VPC infrastructure needs
  - Select the smallest viable CIDR range to conserve IP address space within your organization

### SNS and SQS Integration
- **Message Routing Architecture**:
  - For separating and processing different message types efficiently:
    - Create a single Amazon SNS topic
    - Subscribe multiple Amazon SQS queues to the topic
    - Configure SNS message filtering to route messages to appropriate queues based on message attributes
  - Ensures messages are separated by type and processed appropriately
  - Prevents message loss with SQS's durable message storage
  - Maximizes operational efficiency with automated message routing
  - More efficient than creating multiple separate SNS topics
  - Simpler than using Kinesis streams for basic message routing scenarios
  - Perfect for use cases where messages must be guaranteed processing within specific timeframes
